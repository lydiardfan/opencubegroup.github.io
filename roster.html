      <h3>King</h3>      <p>        <b>Type of Player</b>:  Conservative and careful with his low bids<br />        <b>Favored Partner</b>:  Magic<br />        <b>Refused Partners</b>:  Spoch, Palmer<br />        <b>Scores</b>:  SAT Math: 800, GRE Math: 770, GRE Analytical: 750<br />        <b>Favorite Quote During a Game</b>:  While you're up...<br />        <b>Specialty</b>:  Sticking others with luggage in a dumpfest<br />        <b>Scouting Report</b>:  A tough opponent.  He generally plays by the book and rarely makes mistakes.  Solid all around.  Doesn't gamble on too many lows, and needs some convincing before he will let his partner go low.  Difficult to get on a low bid since he only goes when he is in the books.  Very tough in 2-man, as he excels in dumping bags.  Classic lurer/underbidder at times, specifically in 2-man.       </p>            <h3> Spoch</h3>      <p>        <b>Type of Player</b>:  Will go low or blind low whenever mathematically possible<br />        <b>Favored Partner</b>:  Spot<br />        <b>Refused Partner</b>:  Palmer<br />        <b>Scores</b>:  SAT Math:  790, GMAT:  650<br />        <b>Specialty</b>:  Spiting, especially on lows<br />        <b>Favorite Quote During a Game</b>:  The attempt is always made !!<br />        <b>Scouting Report</b>:  Has the potential to be among the world's best, but loves to gamble.  Is a good partner when there is money on the table, and he plays cautiously.  He's a guy you have to really watch, as he's been know to toss off and not follow suit.  One of the best on low hands, both protecting and spiting.  Another top notch 2-man player, and he's had some epic battles with King over the years including the infamous "grate" incident.  Has a habit of always getting up when it is his turn to bid.      </p>            <h3> Palmer</h3>      <p>        <b>Type of Player</b>:  Likes to go low &#8212; on every hand<br />        <b>Favored Partner</b>:  King<br />        <b>Refused Partners</b>:  Spoch<br />        <b>Scores</b>:  LSAT: 164<br />         <b>Favorite Quote During a Game</b>:  Can you protect?<br />        <b>Specialty</b>:  Going low<br />        <b>Scouting Report</b>:  Gambles all the time.  Has been known to attempt some questionable lows (i.e., bare Ace of Clubs &#8212; Although, in his defense, he did this only because King threatened to bust his head open if he didn't since he had 8 in his hand).  Otherwise solid strategically.  For some reason he refused to move to SF and chose SD instead.  His ranking will fall accordingly.       </p>            <h3>Magic</h3>      <p>        <b>Type of Player</b>:  Mildly conservative, always pushes partner to go low<br />        <b>Favored Partners</b>:  King/Spoch<br />        <b>Refused Partners</b>:  None<br />        <b>Scores</b>:  GRE Math: 780, GRE Analytical:  760<br />         <b>Favorite Quote During a Game</b>:  Don't pick up!!!!<br />        <b>Specialty</b>:  Protecting partner on low bid<br />        <b>Scouting Report</b>:  He's your standard "by the book" type of player.  Keeps track of the cards reasonably well, and doesn't make many mistakes.  Will gamble on occasion, and loves to have his partner go BL.  Has been known to play for long periods of time (an entire fall break, and routinely on every track/cross country trip).      </p>            <h3>Avila</h3>      <p>        <b>Type of Player</b>:  Tries to go low at least 50% of the time<br />        <b>Favored Partners</b>:  Magic/Carpe<br />        <b>Refused Partner</b>:  Spoch<br />        <b>Scores</b>:  NA<br />         <b>Favorite Quote During a Game</b>:  The man has one diamond!!!<br />        <b>Specialty</b>:  Going low<br />        <b>Scouting Report</b>:  Likes to go low and will attempt whenever the opportunity presents, regardless of the score.  Can get distracted easily, particularly when the Phils or Flyers are on TV.      </p>            <h3>Carpenter</h3>      <p>        <b>Type of Player</b>:  Conservative &#8212; by the book<br />        <b>Favored Partner</b>:  Avila<br />        <b>Refused Partner</b>:  Spoch<br />        <b>Scores</b>:  NA<br />         <b>Favorite Quote During a Game</b>:  Shut up!<br />        <b>Specialty</b>:  Spiting on lows<br />        <b>Scouting Report</b>:  Tough to sneak a low by him, as he spites at all costs.  Can get excited easily &#8212; evidenced by extreme tapping of his right index finger, or "jiggling" his right leg.      </p>            <h3>Knobloch</h3>      <p>        <b>Type of Player</b>:  Gambler &#8212; loves to go low<br />        <b>Favored Partner</b>:  Kearney<br />        <b>Refused Partner</b>:  Spoch<br />        <b>Scores</b>:  GRE Math: 760, GRE Analytical: 730<br />         <b>Favorite Quote During a Game</b>:  I'm going!<br />        <b>Specialty</b>:  Taunting<br />        <b>Scouting Report</b>:  Dedicated to the game.  The fact that King and Magic are in the Bay Area could have been the deciding factor in his grad school choice. With his move to Berkeley in the fall of '98, they are in need of a fourth out West.  Palmer may be forced to make the trip up from SD weekly.      </p>            <h3>Kearney</h3>      <p>        <b>Type of Player</b>:  Conservative &#8212; can be talked into going low<br />        <b>Favored Partner</b>:  Any<br />        <b>Refused Partner</b>:  Spoch<br />        <b>Scores</b>:  NA<br />         <b>Favorite Quote During a Game</b>:  On the backstreets of Dodge!<br />        <b>Specialty</b>:  <br />        <b>Scouting Report</b>:  Does an excellent job of concealing the type of hand he has.  This is due to the fact that he is always smiling and shaking as though he is nervous.  Has a promising career ahead of him if he can just find adequate competition back in Lewisburg, now that all of the big guns are gone.  One of the quicker learners in the game today.  Now he needs to teach some of the younger guys the finer points of spiting, dumping, etc., as he is the final hope for spades to continue at Bucknell.  Will likely be forced to attend either Cal, Stanford or Chico State for grad school.      </p>            <h3>Clarke</h3>      <p>        <b>Type of Player</b>:  Conservative<br />        <b>Favored Partner</b>:  Any<br />        <b>Refused Partner</b>:  Too nice of a guy to refuse anyone<br />        <b>Scores</b>:  NA<br />         <b>Favorite Quote During a Game</b>:  A Taunting!<br />        <b>Specialty</b>:  Protecting on lows<br />        <b>Scouting Report</b>:  One of the quickest guys ever to pick up the game.  Has been known to play until 7:00 am on occasion.  With his move from Tennessee to San Diego with Palmer, he will likely pick up the intracacies of 2 man &#8212; unless Palmer corrupts him.  Steady and solid partner.  Plays a conservative game and won't make major gambles or mistakes.       </p>
